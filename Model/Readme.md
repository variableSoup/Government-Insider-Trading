# 🧠 SMTE Model & Evaluation Phase

> This stage is where we build, train, and evaluate ML models using the labeled data — all inside **Google Cloud**.

---

## 🏗️ What We Do Here

- ⚙️ Train classification and regression models on smart money features  
- 🧠 Use **Vertex AI** and **BigQuery ML** for scalable, explainable training  
- 📊 Evaluate models with key metrics and custom SQL queries

---

## 🧪 Models Built

- ✅ Logistic regression (binary classification)
- 📈 Linear regression (price movement prediction)
- 🧠 Optional: XGBoost via Vertex AI custom jobs

## 📉 Metrics Tracked

| Metric         | Description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `accuracy`     | Binary classification precision   |
| `log_loss`     | Model confidence loss             |
| `roc_auc`      | Signal quality vs noise benchmark |
| `r_squared`    | Fit score for price prediction    |
